# Classification of MNIST digits via SVD decomposition

In this homework Singular Value Decomposition is used to classificate MNIST digits. This dataset, which is loaded in the form of a 256 × 1707 matrix, contains the flattened version of 1707 16 × 16 grayscale handwritten digits between 0 and 9.

A binary classification problem was considered, where it was required to classificate if a given digit of dimension m x n represents the number 3 or the number 4 whose class is C1 and C2 respectively.

After that, a multiclass model is presented following the same steps of the binary classifier.
